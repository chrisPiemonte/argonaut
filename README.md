## Introduction

The goals of argumentation are to identify, analyze and evaluate arguments. In particular, we give reasons to support or criticize a claim that is doubtful. In giving and evaluating reasons we engage in a reasoning process: we make connections between premises and conclusions.

One of the most influential computational models of argument was presented by Dungâ€™s Argumentation Frameworks (AF), which is roughly a directed graph where the vertices are the abstract arguments and the directed edges correspond to attacks between them. The abstract nature of the arguments, and the relationship with non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, yield a very simple and quite general model that allows to easily understand which sets of arguments are mutually compatible. The precise conditions for their acceptance are defined by the semantics. 

Semantics can be divided into two large families:
- **Extension-based Semantics**: acceptable subsets of the arguments, called extensions, that correspond to various positions one may take based on the available arguments. 

- **Ranking-based semantics**: the other recent family of acceptability semantics has been defined recently, in which there are no acceptable subsets and arguments cannot only be accepted or rejected, but using a membership criterion, a qualitative acceptability degree is assigned to each argument.


## Abstract

The goal of this project is to propose an hybrid approach between the two families of semantics. Subsets within a semantics are all equally good, by ranking them, however, we try to impose an order relationship based on what we value most. The approach tries to rank the subsets generated by the different semantics by using metrics that can range from real-world domain metrics to more abstract and theoretical metrics according to the situation under consideration. 

Two steps are needed to generate a ranking of the subsets:
- First we need to generate subsets of arguments by using one of the classical Extension-based Semantics
- Then we can compute a score for each subset (e.g. the closeness between the arguments inside the subset, or the similarity between the texts associated with each node inside the subset) and then rank them.



To do so the work is divided in two parts:

- [Crawler](#): First of all we need the data, this is done by crawling social media conversations and creating the graph.
- [Reasoner](#): Then subsets are generated by applying Extension-based Semantics and finally a score function is applied to each subset. 


## Setup
I suggest to setup a virtual environment using [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)

1. Clone this repo:  <pre>git clone https://github.com/chrisPiemonte/argonaut.git</pre> <pre>cd argonaut/</pre>

2. Put your credentials in ```res/credentials.yml```

3. Create an environment with python 3.6: <pre>conda env create -f env.yml</pre>

4. Switch to that environment: <pre>source activate argonaut_env</pre>

5. Check the notebooks: <pre>jupyter lab</pre>
